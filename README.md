<p>Well done! Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you've become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.</p>

<p>As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.</p>

<h4>Observable Trends</h4>

<p>Students at charter schools have higher average reading and math scores than students at district schools. The average math score at charter schools is about 6.5 points higher than the average math score at district schools, and the average reading score is about 3 points higher at charter schools than the average reading score at district schools. Furthermore, charter schools also have a higher percentage of students passing math and reading than district schools. About 17% more students are passing math at charter schools compared to district schools, and about 16% more students are passing reading at charter schools than at district schools.</p>

<p>Similarly, students at smaller schools also have higher average math and reading scores than students at larger schools. Interestingly, the average math and reading scores at schools with under 1,000 students and schools with 1,000-2,000 students are roughly equal, and the percentage of students passing math and reading at small and medium-size schools are also almost equivalent. However, students at schools with 2,000-5,000 students lower average reading and math scores than students at small or medium-size schools. The average reading score is only about 2.5 points lower at larger schools, but the average math scores drop by about 5.5 percent at large schools compared with small or medium-size schools. The percentage of students passing math and reading at large schools are also lower - about 14% fewer students are passing reading and about 24% fewer students are passing math at large school compared with smaller schools.</p>
